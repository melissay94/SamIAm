		<h1>About Sam I Am</h1>
		<p>Sam I Am is a recipe generator for the week! The inspiration for the name comes from Sam I Am by Doctor Suess, where Sam wants his friend to try new foods. Hopefully this too will inspire people to try new foods!</p>
		<h3>How it works</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>You press the generator button! It will kick up some tasty stuff from the Recipe Puppy API.</li>
			<li>Once you've found a recipe you want, go ahead and assign it a week day! It'll be added to your list.</li>
			<li>Open up the "My Recipes" tab and ta-da! You now have a schedule for what day you want to eat and a shopping list of everything you'll need!</li>
			<li>Have fun cooking!</li>
		</ol>
        <p><b>What's next for SamIAm?</b> Not sure right now, still figuring out some of the basics such as being able to take recipes off of your shopping list if you decide you don't want them. Also being able to actually send you your shopping list would be cool.</p>
